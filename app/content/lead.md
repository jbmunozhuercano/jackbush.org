The compilation of a comprehensive record of paintings produced by the Canadian
artist Jack Bush (1909 – 1977) is currently in process and made possible by the
Estate of the artist. The catalogue raisonné will thoroughly document more than
1,600 paintings, including full information on provenance, exhibitions,
bibliography, excerpts from the artist's own diary, and so much more.
